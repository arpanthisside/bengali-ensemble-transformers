## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated Bengali emotion detection system using ensemble transformer models. The web application provides real-time emotion analysis of Bengali text through an ensemble of three state-of-the-art transformer models, complete with comprehensive visualization and insights.

## System Architecture

### Ensemble Model Components

1. **BanglaBERT** (Weight: 40%)
   - Architecture: ELECTRA-based discriminator model
   - Accuracy: 72.89% on sentiment classification
   - Description: State-of-the-art Bengali language model with Replaced Token Detection (RTD) objective

2. **Bangla-BERT-Base** (Weight: 35%)
   - Architecture: BERT-base-uncased (12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads)
   - Accuracy: 70.37% on sentiment analysis
   - Description: Specialized Bengali BERT model trained on Bengali corpus

3. **mBERT** (Weight: 25%)
   - Architecture: Multilingual BERT
   - Accuracy: 67.59% on sentiment classification
   - Description: Cross-lingual capabilities for Bengali text understanding

### Ensemble Methodology

The system employs **soft voting ensemble** method:
- Each model produces probability distributions for 6 emotions
- Weighted averaging based on model performance
- Final prediction combines all model outputs

## Emotion Categories

The system detects 6 basic emotions based on Ekman's emotion model:
1. **Joy** (আনন্দ) - Golden Yellow (#FFD700)
2. **Sadness** (দুঃখ) - Royal Blue (#4169E1)
3. **Anger** (রাগ) - Orange Red (#FF4500)
4. **Fear** (ভয়) - Dark Magenta (#8B008B)
5. **Surprise** (বিস্ময়) - Hot Pink (#FF69B4)
6. **Disgust** (ঘৃণা) - Forest Green (#228B22)

### 2. Negative Emotion
- **Input**: "আমি খুব দুঃখিত এই ব্যাপারে" (I am very sad about this)
- **Expected Output**: Sadness (78% confidence)

### 3. Anger Expression
- **Input**: "এটা খুবই রাগের ব্যাপার" (This is very angering)
- **Expected Output**: Anger (85% confidence)

## Performance Metrics
